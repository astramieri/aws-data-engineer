# Data Engineering Fundamentals

Types of Data:
- Structured
- Unstructured
- Semi-structured

## Structured Data

Data that is organized in a defined manner or schema, typically found in relational databases.

Characteristics:
- easily queryable
- organized in rows and columns
- has a consistent structure

Examples:
- Databases tables
- CSV files with consistent columns
- Excel spreadsheets

## Unstructured Data

Data that does not have a predefined structure or schema.

Characteristics:
- not easily queryable without preprocessing
- may come in various format

Examples:
- Text files without a fixed format
- Videos and audio files
- Images
- Emails and word processing documents

## Semi-structured Data

Data that is not organized as structured data but has some level of structure in the form of tags, hierarchies, or other patterns.

Characteristics:
- elements might be tagged or categorized in some way
- more flexible that structured data but not as chaotic as unstructured data

Examples:
- XML and JSON files
- email headers 
- log files with varied formats
